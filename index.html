                    <h3>MongoDB</h3>
                    <p>MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB allows you to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data with ease. Its document-oriented model makes it ideal for applications where the structure of the data can change over time. It also scales horizontally, making it suitable for high-traffic, large-scale applications.</p>

                    <h3>Express JS</h3>
                    <p>Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to build web and mobile applications. It helps in creating APIs and handling HTTP requests, making it simpler to develop server-side logic. Express.js streamlines building the back-end of applications by providing middleware, routing, and easy integration with databases.</p>

                <div class="blue">
                    <h3>React JS</h3>
                    <p>React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications where the UI needs to be highly interactive. Developed by Facebook, React allows developers to create reusable UI components, manage application state efficiently, and update views dynamically in response to user interactions. Its declarative nature and virtual DOM make it fast and scalable.</p>

                <div class="green">
                    <h3>Node JS</h3>
                    <p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, designed to execute JavaScript code on the server side. Unlike traditional server-side languages, Node.js is event-driven and non-blocking, making it ideal for building scalable network applications. It enables developers to use JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development, unifying the technology stack.</p>
